i want to develop a personal portfolio website for myself with details below:

- My old website is in /Users/vignesh/personal/repos/tvvignesh.github.io/old which has a lot of basic details.
- My linkedin profile is in /Users/vignesh/personal/repos/tvvignesh.github.io/Profile.md
- Add all sections in my portfolio to make it very catchy and attractive.
- Tech stack I love: React.js, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, Next.js, Shadcn, GraphQL, Docker, Kubernetes, GCP, AWS, Azure, Milvus, Langchain, Agno, Claude Code (and other AI tools), Canva, Notion, Linear, Github, Capacitor.js, etc.
Other technologies and other details are mentioned in my resume here: /Users/vignesh/personal/repos/tvvignesh.github.io/tvvignesh.md


Update the current code in /Users/vignesh/personal/repos/tvvignesh.github.io to create the website end-end

Make sure there are no lint, build, type errors and warnings

----

- Add Cursor, MCP, ChatGPT, Gamma, v0 to the stack
- deduplicate the experience - you added the same experience in multiple places
- Instead of using initials as V.T.V use T.V in the header
- remove Download Resume option from the website
- add a section for talks given and mention these: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j6xxtj5rjE , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6y_GV87Cbc ,  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQPgQ3oOoJo
- add a section for publications and mention this: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10810802

change styling in such a way that user does not need to scroll too much since experience, projects, etc. take too much of space

also update the youtube description based on these:

1st video:

In this talk, we will walk through GraphQL and the ecosystem around it as a whole. We will look at fully typed end-end architectures, address the most common questions/gotchas, the various tools which can help you in your workflow and how you can incrementally scale up your stack as your usecase demands it with code walkthroughs wherever applicable.
This talk would be based on the GraphQL series as published here:   / graphql-diving-deep  

Vignesh is the founder of Timecampus, a bootstrapped startup building a Time Management Platform for users and businesses. Before becoming a solopreneur, he led a research and development team of 25 at Ramco Systems and also served as a consultant there for some time.

He spends his free time blogging on Medium about a range of topics, from time management and productivity to the open source ecosystem - GraphQL, Kubernetes, Web Components, Architecture and so on. He also enjoys providing feedback and helping out with open source projects.


2nd video:

In this talk, we will discuss the various pieces that make up a Web 3.0 app and explore deeply how GraphQL glues everything together by abstracting the complexity while still exposing the power that Web 3.0 has to offer.

Vignesh T.V. - The Guild Dev, CTO of timecampus.com
