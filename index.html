                  <p>
                  This is my startup. I had worked on various things ranging from developing web apps to getting a magazine released.
                  <br>
                  I made a social networking platform trying to overcome Facebook's challenges which has now been opensourced and made available at <a href="https://www.github.com/tvvignesh">Github</a>.
                  The product was shut down by me due to various mistakes I made in the course but it was a good learning process for me.
                  <br>
                  I try to keep myself occupied by working on new initiatives and products staying upto date.
